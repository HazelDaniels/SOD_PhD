# Moving the files from the CGRB sequencing structure to the lab_folder

- **Source:** `/nfs2/hts/illumina/200710_J00107_0244_AHGLLYBBXY_1503/L12`
- **Destination:** `/nfs1/BPP/LeBoldus_Lab/lab_data/ramorum`

> Notes: Lanes 1 and 2 include the ramorum data

## Step 1: Creating a list of data to be moved 

> Pseudocode: For each of the lane1|lane2 fastq, paste the command (cp), the source and the destination

```bash
bash
for i in /nfs2/hts/illumina/190410_J00107_0201_AH3VJGBBXY_1461/L125678/lane[12]/*; do a=$(readlink -f $i); b=$(basename $i); printf "cp "$a" ""/nfs1/BPP/LeBoldus_Lab/lab_data/ramorum/"$b"\n"; done > move_files.sh
```

## Step 2: Running the script to copy the files from source to destination

```bash
qsub move_files.sh
```
